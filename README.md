# JavaScript Web Projects Collection

## Overview

This repository showcases a variety of JavaScript web projects that I developed to strengthen my programming skills. The projects range from basic exercises, such as DOM manipulation and mini-games, to more advanced applications like an interactive map and bank transactions. These projects were created with the help of online courses and YouTube tutorials.

## Projects

### Bank Landing Page

A fictional landing page for a bank website demonstrating basic DOM manipulation and styling. This project includes features like responsive design, form validation, and smooth scrolling.

**Key Features:**
- Responsive design using CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Interactive form with validation using JavaScript
- Smooth scrolling and navigation bar highlight based on the current section

### Guess the Number Game

A simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. This project helped me practice conditional statements, event handling, and basic logic.

**Key Features:**
- Random number generation and validation
- User input handling and feedback
- Score tracking and game reset functionality

### Dice Game

A two-player dice game where players take turns rolling the dice, and the first to reach a certain score wins. This project reinforced concepts like loops, conditionals, and DOM manipulation.

**Key Features:**
- Two-player mode with alternating turns
- Dice roll simulation using random numbers
- Score tracking and winner announcement

### Interactive Map

An advanced project that integrates a mapping API to display locations on a map. The user can add markers, view details, and interact with the map in real-time.

**Key Features:**
- Integration with a mapping API (e.g., Leaflet or Google Maps)
- Custom markers with pop-up details
- Dynamic map updates based on user interactions

### Bank Transactions App

A more complex project simulating a basic banking system where users can log in, view their balance, and perform transactions like deposits and withdrawals. This project involves data manipulation, event handling, and UI updates.

**Key Features:**
- User authentication simulation
- Transaction history and balance updates
- Transfer between accounts and log out functionality

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the web pages
- **CSS3** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for logic and interactivity
- **API Integration** (for advanced projects like the Interactive Map)

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
